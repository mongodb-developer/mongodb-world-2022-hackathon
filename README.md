# MongoDB World 2022 Hackathon

A demo using the GDELT dataset as part of the MongoDB World 2022 Hackathon.

This particular project is broken up into multiple pieces:

- Scripts
- UX

The project is dependent on having had the GDELT dataset loaded into MongoDB. The scripts will process the data and fill in the gaps so that the UX will be able to load and render data in a news feed with search and geospatial attributes.

To learn more about each of the components, click into each of the scripts or UX and read about what they do in the associated README file.
